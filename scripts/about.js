    <div className="About">
        <p className="Text">I am a Junior programmer who is actively trying to learn. All kinds of development interests me and I someday hope to be able to work on the cutting edge of technology.</p>
        <p className="Text">I believe that in order to say you've mastered something, you should be able to teach it. At my time at <a href="https://www.grandcircus.co/">Grand Circus</a> as a teaching assistant I taught 50 students over 5 front-end(AngularJS) and back-end(C#.Net Framework) coding bootcamps to be job ready by the end. During which I started the job while in college.</p>
        <p className="Text">Since my time there I've taken a job at <a href="https://www.structuralconcepts.com/">Structual Concepts</a> where I built them software that would help making ordering easier. By sorting through models and then getting all relevant parts, getting an order set up was as easy as pressing a few buttons and it would grab all the needed info.</p>
        <p className="Text">During Corona, I've taken up learning Unreal Engine. This engine allows me to create my own games and express myself through it. Another Skill I learned is ReactJS, which this website is made with. I look forward to talking with you and growing together!</p>
